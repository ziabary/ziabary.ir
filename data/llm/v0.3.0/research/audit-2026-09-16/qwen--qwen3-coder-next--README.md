# Qwen3-Coder-Next

## Highlights

Today, we're announcing **Qwen3-Coder-Next**, an open-weight language model designed specifically for coding agents and local development. It features the following key enhancements:  

- **Super Efficient with Significant Performance**: With only 3B activated parameters (80B total parameters), it achieves performance comparable to models with 10–20x more active parameters, making it highly cost-effective for agent deployment.
- **Advanced Agentic Capabilities**: Through an elaborate training recipe, it excels at long-horizon reasoning, complex tool usage, and recovery from execution failures, ensuring robust performance in dynamic coding tasks.
- **Versatile Integration with Real-World IDE**: Its 256k context length, combined with adaptability to various scaffold templates, enables seamless integration with different CLI/IDE platforms (e.g., Claude Code, Qwen Code, Qoder, Kilo, Trae, Cline, etc.), supporting diverse development environments.

For more details, including benchmark evaluation, hardware requirements, and inference performance, please refer to our [blog](https://qwen.ai/blog?id=qwen3-coder-next), [GitHub](https://github.com/QwenLM/Qwen3-Coder), and [Documentation](https://qwen.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).


## Quickstart

We advise you to use the latest version of `transformers`.

The following contains a code snippet illustrating how to use the model generate content based on given inputs. 
```python
from transformers import AutoModelForCausalLM, AutoTokenizer

model_name = "Qwen/Qwen3-Coder-Next"

# load the tokenizer and the model
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_name)
model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(
  model_name,
  torch_dtype="auto",
  device_map="auto"
)

# prepare the model input
prompt = "Write a quick sort algorithm."
messages = [
  {"role": "user", "content": prompt}
]
text = tokenizer.apply_chat_template(
  messages,
  tokenize=False,
  add_generation_prompt=True,
)
model_inputs = tokenizer([text], return_tensors="pt").to(model.device)

# conduct text completion
generated_ids = model.generate(
    **model_inputs,
    max_new_tokens=65536
)
output_ids = generated_ids[0][len(model_inputs.input_ids[0]):].tolist() 

content = tokenizer.decode(output_ids, skip_special_tokens=True)

print("content:", content)
```

**Note: If you encounter out-of-memory (OOM) issues, consider reducing the context length to a shorter value, such as `32,768`.**

For local use, applications such as Ollama, LMStudio, MLX-LM, llama.cpp, and KTransformers have also supported Qwen3.

## Deployment

For deployment, you can use the latest `sglang` or `vllm` to create an OpenAI-compatible API endpoint.

### SGLang

[SGLang](https://github.com/sgl-project/sglang) is a fast serving framework for large language models and vision language models.
SGLang could be used to launch a server with OpenAI-compatible API service. 

`sglang>=v0.5.8` is required for Qwen3-Coder-Next, which can be installed using:
```shell
pip install 'sglang[all]>=v0.5.8'
```
See [its documentation](https://docs.sglang.ai/get_started/install.html) for more details.

The following command can be used to create an API endpoint at `http://localhost:30000/v1` with maximum context length 256K tokens using tensor parallel on 4 GPUs.
```shell
python -m sglang.launch_server --model Qwen/Qwen3-Coder-Next --port 30000 --tp-size 2 --tool-call-parser qwen3_coder
```

> [!Note]
> The default context length is 256K. Consider reducing the context length to a smaller value, e.g., `32768`, if the server fails to start.


### vLLM

[vLLM](https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm) is a high-throughput and memory-efficient inference and serving engine for LLMs.
vLLM could be used to launch a server with OpenAI-compatible API service. 

`vllm>=0.15.0` is required for Qwen3-Coder-Next, which can be installed using:
```shell
pip install 'vllm>=0.15.0'
```
See [its documentation](https://docs.vllm.ai/en/stable/getting_started/installation/index.html) for more details.

The following command can be used to create an API endpoint at `http://localhost:8000/v1` with maximum context length 256K tokens using tensor parallel on 4 GPUs.
```shell
vllm serve Qwen/Qwen3-Coder-Next --port 8000 --tensor-parallel-size 2 --enable-auto-tool-choice --tool-call-parser qwen3_coder
```

> [!Note]
> The default context length is 256K. Consider reducing the context length to a smaller value, e.g., `32768`, if the server fails to start.


## Agentic Coding

Qwen3-Coder-Next excels in tool calling capabilities. 

You can simply define or use any tools as following example.
```python
# Your tool implementation
def square_the_number(num: float) -> dict:
    return num ** 2

# Define Tools
tools=[
    {
        "type":"function",
        "function":{
            "name": "square_the_number",
            "description": "output the square of the number.",
            "parameters": {
                "type": "object",
                "required": ["input_num"],
                "properties": {
                    'input_num': {
                        'type': 'number', 
                        'description': 'input_num is a number that will be squared'
                        }
                },
            }
        }
    }
]

from openai import OpenAI
# Define LLM
client = OpenAI(
    # Use a custom endpoint compatible with OpenAI API
    base_url='http://localhost:8000/v1',  # api_base
    api_key="EMPTY"
)
 
messages = [{'role': 'user', 'content': 'square the number 1024'}]

completion = client.chat.completions.create(
    messages=messages,
    model="Qwen3-Coder-Next",
    max_tokens=65536,
    tools=tools,
)

print(completion.choices[0])
```

## Best Practices

To achieve optimal performance, we recommend the following sampling parameters: `temperature=1.0`, `top_p=0.95`, `top_k=40`.
